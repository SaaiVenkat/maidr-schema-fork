# MAIDR Schema

This repository contains detailed specifications for the MAIDR (Multimodal Access and Interactive Data Representation) schema. It includes examples and is a work in progress. You can find it applied in various use cases.

Currently, the MAIDR specification supports Cartesian-based coordinate plots. Future updates will extend support to other types of coordinates, such as polar plots, 3D plots, and geo-spatial maps.
